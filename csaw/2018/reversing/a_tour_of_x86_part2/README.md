# A Tour of x86 - Part 2

Open stage2 in a disassembler, and figure out how to jump to the rest of the code!

## Proof of Flag
flag{0ne_sm411_JMP_for_x86_on3_m4ss1ve_1eap_4_Y0U}

## Summary
Patched out a halt instruction to allow the "os" to do its decryption stuff.

## Proof of Solving
From the previous stage we know that the contents of the file stage-2.bin will
be loaded at address 0x6000 and execution will be redirected at that address.
The problem is that the first byte of the second stage is a halt instruction.
By simply changing that to a 0x90 = nop and rebuilding the image we allow the
rest of the code to run. It probably does some crypto stuff but I didnâ€™t have to
look through it as it writes the flag to the framebuffer.
