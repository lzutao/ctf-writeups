Can you find the flag using the following assembly [source][1]?
WARNING: It is VERY long...

## Hints

Hmm.. There must be an easier way than reversing the whole thing right?

---

```sh
% make
% ./test.elf
```

picoCTF{1_h0p3_y0u_c0mP1l3d_tH15_2350040222}

Note:
  If your flag does not work,
  EITHER replace the trailing '3's at the end with a '}' OR
  change '2390040222' to '2350040222' and change '70u' to 'y0u'.
